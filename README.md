# MoMath Hackathon 2018: Buffon's Needle Drop
Math Square Behavior
Lawrence Yip && Travis Claus
# The Math
Visualization of the classic Geometric Probability problem, Buffon's Needle Drop.
# The Submission
This is what I Believe to be an excellent project to invest more into. When the relations between these variables 
is explored from a data science perspective their are beutiful visualizations that can be displayed along side the data
as it is gathered for the audience. I believe that this would engage those with an interest in probability, and
expose many to the amazing reality that PI is a very present entity in our surroundings.
